### Automated Tests

- Given/Arrange -> When/Act -> Then/Assert
- Having 100% unit test coverage does not guarantee 100% correctness.

- FIRST:
  * Fast: Tests must execute quickly.
  * Independent: Each test should be independent of others.
  * Repeatable: Test results should be consistent regardless of how many times they are run.
  * Self-Validating: Tests should validate themselves.
  * Timely: Tests should be written before, during, or shortly after the code.

- TDD (Test-Driven Development): Write tests -> Make the code work -> Eliminate redundancy
